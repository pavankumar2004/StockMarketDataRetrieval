# StockMarketDataRetrieval
This GitHub repository hosts a Python-based project that demonstrates the retrieval of real-time stock market data using the Alpha Vantage API. The project also showcases the efficient management of this data using Splay Trees and Red-Black Trees, all wrapped in a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.
